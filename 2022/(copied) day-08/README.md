# Day 8 - Advent of Code

You can find the link for day 8, 2022 [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/8). This folder will provide complete solutions for part 1 and part 2 of day 8.

NOTE: This code was used from GitHub User [Phippre](https://github.com/Phippre/Advent-of-Code-2022/tree/main/Day8). (I didn't have enough time to complete it)

## Setup

To run this code, you should get the input from [this link](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/8/input) and paste it into `logs.txt` but my input is already provided as a sample. You should also make sure to have Python installed (I use Python 3.10.7 but it should work with most versions).

# Run The Code

```bash
python3 ./part-1-treetop-tree-house.py
python3 ./part-2-treetop-tree-house.py
```
