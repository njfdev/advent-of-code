# Day 23 - Advent of Code

You can find the link for day 23, 2022 [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/23). This folder will provide complete solutions for part 1 and part 2 of day 23.

NOTE: This code was used from GitHub User [Leftfish](https://github.com/Leftfish/Advent-of-Code-2022/blob/master/23/d23.py). (I did not have time today)

## Setup

To run this code, you should get the input from [this link](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/23/input) and paste it into `map.txt` but my input is already provided as a sample. You should also make sure to have Python installed (I use Python 3.10.7 but it should work with most versions).

# Run The Code

python3 unstable-diffusion.py
