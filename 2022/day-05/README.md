# Day 5 - Advent of Code

You can find the link for day 5, 2022 [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5). This folder will provide complete solutions for part 1 and part 2 of day 5.

## Setup

To run this code, you should get the input from [this link](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5/input) and paste it into `stack-data.txt` but my input is already provided as a sample. You should also make sure to have Python installed (I use Python 3.10.7 but it should work with most versions).

# Run Part 1

```bash
python3 ./part-1-supply-stacks.py
```

# Run Part 2

```bash
python3 ./part-2-supply-stacks.py
```
