# Day 10 - Advent of Code

You can find the link for day 10, 2022 [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/10). This folder will provide complete solutions for part 1 and part 2 of day 10.

Note: This one was my favorite so far!

## Setup

To run this code, you should get the input from [this link](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/10/input) and paste it into `instructions.txt` but my input is already provided as a sample. You should also make sure to have Python installed (I use Python 3.10.7 but it should work with most versions).

# Run The Code

This code sample will provide the answer to both parts in 1 file! The text in "ascii art" is the answer to part 2 and the number following it is the answer to part 1.

```bash
python3 cathode-ray-tube.py
```
