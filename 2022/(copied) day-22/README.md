# Day 22 - Advent of Code

You can find the link for day 22, 2022 [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/22). This folder will provide complete solutions for part 1 and part 2 of day 22.

NOTE: This code was used from GitHub User [RKuipers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RKuipers/Advent-of-code/main/2022/day22.py). (I did not have time today)

## Setup

To run this code, you should get the input from [this link](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/22/input) and paste it into `monkey-notes.txt` but my input is already provided as a sample. You should also make sure to have Python installed (I use Python 3.10.7 but it should work with most versions).

# Run The Code

```bash
python3 monkey-map.py
```
