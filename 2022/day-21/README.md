# Day 21 - Advent of Code

You can find the link for day 21, 2022 [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/21). This folder will provide complete solutions for part 1 and part 2 of day 21.

NOTE: Some of this code was used from Reddit user [4t5NqrpMcaxNTFkZp9U](https://pastebin.com/h7uw9Hmn).

## Setup

To run this code, you should get the input from [this link](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/21/input) and paste it into `monkeys.txt` but my input is already provided as a sample. You should also make sure to have Python installed (I use Python 3.10.7 but it should work with most versions).

# Run The Code

You can see my solution that only answers part 1 using this code:

```bash
python3 monkey-math-part-1.py
```

You can get the answer for both part 1 and part 2 from Reddit user 4t5NqrpMcaxNTFkZp9U.

```bash
python3 monkey-math.py
```
