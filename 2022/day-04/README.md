# Day 4 - Advent of Code

You can find the link for day 4, 2022 [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/4). This folder will provide complete solutions for part 1 and part 2 of day 4.

Today, the code is a little different. I only used OpenAI's [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) to write the code with no manual code written.

## Setup

To run this code, you should get the input from [this link](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/4/input) and paste it into `pairs.txt` but my input is already provided as a sample. You should also make sure to have Python installed (I use Python 3.10.7 but it should work with most versions).

# Run Part 1

```bash
python3 ./part-1-camp-cleanup.py
```

# Run Part 2

```bash
python3 ./part-2-camp-cleanup.py
```
