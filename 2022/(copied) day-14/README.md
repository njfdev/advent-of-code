# Day 14 - Advent of Code

You can find the link for day 14, 2022 [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/14). This folder will provide complete solutions for part 1 and part 2 of day 14.

NOTE: This code was used from GitHub User [tobstern](https://github.com/tobstern/AoC2022/blob/master/day14.py). (I did not have time today)

## Setup

To run this code, you should get the input from [this link](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/14/input) and paste it into `rock-data.txt` but my input is already provided as a sample. You should also make sure to have Python installed (I use Python 3.10.7 but it should work with most versions).

# Run The Code

```bash
python3 ./regolith-reservoir.py
```
