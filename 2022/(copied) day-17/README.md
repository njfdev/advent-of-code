# Day 17 - Advent of Code

You can find the link for day 17, 2022 [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/17). This folder will provide complete solutions for part 1 and part 2 of day 17.

NOTE: This code was used from GitHub User [Fadi88](https://github.com/Fadi88/AoC/blob/master/2022/day17/code.py). (I did not have time today)

## Setup

To run this code, you should get the input from [this link](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/17/input) and paste it into `jet-pattern.txt` but my input is already provided as a sample. You should also make sure to have Python installed (I use Python 3.10.7 but it should work with most versions).

# Run The Code

```bash
python3 pyroclastic-flow.py
```
