# Day 6 - Advent of Code

You can find the link for day 6, 2022 [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/6). This folder will provide complete solutions for part 1 and part 2 of day 6.

## Setup

To run this code, you should get the input from [this link](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/6/input) and paste it into `message.txt` but my input is already provided as a sample. You should also make sure to have Python installed (I use Python 3.10.7 but it should work with most versions).

# Run Part 1

python3 ./part-1-tuning-trouble.py
```
