# Day 15 - Advent of Code

You can find the link for day 15, 2022 [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/15). This folder will provide complete solutions for part 1 and part 2 of day 15.

NOTE: This code was used from GitHub User [Fitli](https://github.com/Fitli/AoC2022/blob/main/15.py). (I did not have time today)

## Setup

To run this code, you should get the input from [this link](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/15/input) and paste it into `sensor-data.txt` but my input is already provided as a sample. You should also make sure to have Python installed (I use Python 3.10.7 but it should work with most versions).

# Run The Code

```bash
python3 ./beacon-exclusion-zone.py
```
