# Day 11 - Advent of Code

You can find the link for day 11, 2022 [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/11). This folder will provide complete solutions for part 1 and part 2 of day 11.

Note: I copied the answer for part 2 (with some modifications) from [zy_official](https://github.com/starkindustries/advent-of-code/blob/main/2022/11/solve.py) on Reddit. I could solve part 1, but I had trouble figuring out how to optimize the code for part 2 so it wouldn't take forever.

## Setup

To run this code, you should get the input from [this link](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/11/input) and paste it into `monkeys.txt` but my input is already provided as a sample. You should also make sure to have Python installed (I use Python 3.10.7 but it should work with most versions).

# Run The Code

To the get answer for part 1, run this command:

```bash
python3 part-1-monkey-in-the-middle.py
```

To the get answer for part 2, run this command:

```bash
python3 part-2-monkey-in-the-middle.py
```
