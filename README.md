# Advent of Code

Hello, welcome to my collection of code samples for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). 2022 is the first year I am doing Advent of Code, so older years may be added to this repository after the fact.

The code is structured by year and then day for that year. You can find instructions and explanations in the `README.md` file for each day.

This is repository is a way to prove I did Advent of Code and a way for you to find solutions to Advent of Code. I highly recommend solving these problems on your own because you will learn a lot more. You can refer to this repository if you are stuck or if you want to compare your solutions to mine.

Happy Coding! üë®‚Äçüíª
